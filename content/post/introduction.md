This is an introduction page.  It introduces things.

Through this blog, I will attempt to cover, the four fundamental requirements of being a "good" engineer.  I will also cover books that may be helpful in unerstanding why those requirements are fundamental.  This blog will also cover random posts about how I feel about books I am reading through the year.

The four *fundamental* requirements of being a "good" engineering are as follows (in no particular order):

- Intelligence
- Passion
- Tenacity
- Empathy

One post per month probably.
